# Torch_R_GIoU_3dRotated_BBox_Loss
A Differentiable GIoU Loss with Rotating 3D Bounding Boxes

Change directory in "TORCH_GIoU_Rotating_3d_LOSS_MAIN.r" before running the same file. 

"TORCH_GIoU_Rotating_3d_LOSS_MAIN.r" sources the functions from the other files.

The code generates a dataset to demonstrate the loss function's performance (when it works!)
